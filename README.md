## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Tailwind, DaisyUI, Visual Studio Code

I enjoyed using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to create the beautiful UI components of this site. I used the Tailwind section components to create most of the UI on the site and I used DaisyUI to create the footers on each of the pages. It was a pleasure to work through the hard moments coding this site to reflect the appropriate design and layout. I am a natural problem solver, so with much perseverance and patience, the euphoria of tackling the challenges were well worth it.

**WHAT I LEARNED** 
I spent so many hours trying to figure out why my code would not deploy to Netlify, just to find out that I only needed to upload my dist folder to Netlify. This was the single most frustrating, yet rewarding part of building this website. Frustrating because hours were spent on trying so many different strategies and techniques and researching solutions. Rewarding because I was able to solve the problem to deploying my website and feel the complete satisfaction of allowing users to benefit from Conversation Cue Cards. I can also turn my brain off from trying to solve the problem. I still have building to do, but I am proud of the product that I have, thus far.
