## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Tailwind, DaisyUI, Visual Studio Code

I enjoyed using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to create the beautiful UI components of this site. I used the Tailwind section components to create most of the UI on the site and I used DaisyUI to create the footers on each of the pages. It was a pleasure to work through the hard moments coding this site to reflect the appropriate design and layout. I am a natural problem solver, so with much perseverance and patience, the euphoria of tackling the challenges were well worth it.
